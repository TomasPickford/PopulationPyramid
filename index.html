    <p>This example must be hosted on a server (rather than opened as a file) to avoid most browsers throwing a CORS (security) error.</p>
    <p>This chart shows the populations of males (in blue) and females (in pink) of different age groups in Spain.
        You can view previous decades to see how average lifespan has increased,
        and how individual generations have declined over the years.</p>
